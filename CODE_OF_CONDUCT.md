# Dorothy AI Code of Conduct

As a the founder and principal contributor of the Dorothy AI project, I'm committed to maintaining a welcoming environment for everyone who participates in this initative. This means that I'll strive to treat all contributors with respect and consideration.

To ensure that this project remains a positive and productive space for collaboration, I have established the following guidelines for conduct:

    * Be respectful and considerate of others. This includes refraining from any form of harassment, discrimination, or offensive language. Cursing is fine unless used for the purposes to insult or offend.

    * Contribute in a constructive manner. Criticism and feedback are always welcome, but it should be delivered in a helpful and respectful way.

    * Maintain confidentiality and respect others' privacy. Any personal information shared by contributors should be kept confidential, and contributors should not share any sensitive information without explicit consent.

    * Follow the project's code of conduct and guidelines for contributing. This includes adhering to the PEP 8 guidelines for code style and formatting.

If at any point I feel that a contributor is not upholding these guidelines, I reserve the right to take action, including warning the contributor or revoking their privileges to contribute.

If you have any questions or concerns about these guidelines or any aspect of contributing to Dorothy AI, please don't hesitate to contact me at eros@theotherEros.com
